# HBMS
Home Budget Management System
In the early 90's i used a product called HMBS for managing my personal spending. The software and company that produced it are no longer around, so I thought I might recreate the product. 
It will help a person to analyse how much amount he has to use as his expenditure considering amount of money he is earning with keeping savings in his/her mind.
